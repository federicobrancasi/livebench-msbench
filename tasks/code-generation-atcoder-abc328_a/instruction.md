There is a programming contest with N problems. For each i = 1, 2, \ldots, N, the score for the i-th problem is S_i.
Print the total score for all problems with a score of X or less.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N X
S_1 S_2 \ldots S_N

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- All input values are integers.
- 4 \leq N \leq 8
- 100 \leq S_i \leq 675
- 100 \leq X \leq 675

Sample Input 1

6 200
100 675 201 200 199 328

Sample Output 1

499

Three problems have a score of 200 or less: the first, fourth, and fifth, for a total score of S_1 + S_4 + S_5 = 100 + 200 + 199 = 499.

Sample Input 2

8 675
675 675 675 675 675 675 675 675
