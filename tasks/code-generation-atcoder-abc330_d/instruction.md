You are given an N \times N grid. Let (i,j) denote the cell in the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left.
The states of the cells are given by N strings of length N, S_1, S_2, \dots, S_N, in the following format:

- If the j-th character of S_i is o, there is an o written in cell (i,j).
- If the j-th character of S_i is x, there is an x written in cell (i,j).

Find the number of triples of cells that satisfy all of the following conditions:

- The three cells in the triple are distinct.
- All three cells have an o written in them.
- Exactly two of the cells are in the same row.
- Exactly two of the cells are in the same column.

Here, two triples are considered different if and only if some cell is contained in exactly one of the triples.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
