Print an arithmetic sequence with first term A, last term B, and common difference D.
You are only given inputs for which such an arithmetic sequence exists.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B D

Output

Print the terms of the arithmetic sequence with first term A, last term B, and common difference D, in order, separated by spaces.

Constraints


- 1 \leq A \leq B \leq 100
- 1 \leq D \leq 100
- There is an arithmetic sequence with first term A, last term B, and common difference D.
- All input values are integers.
