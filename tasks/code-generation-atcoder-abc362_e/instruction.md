You are given a sequence A = (A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N) of length N. For each k = 1, 2, \dots, N, find the number, modulo 998244353, of (not necessarily contiguous) subsequences of A of length k that are arithmetic sequences. Two subsequences are distinguished if they are taken from different positions, even if they are equal as sequences.

What is a subsequence?
A subsequence of a sequence A is a sequence obtained by deleting zero or more elements from A and arranging the remaining elements without changing the order.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 \dots A_N

Output

Print the answers for k = 1, 2, \dots, N in this order, in a single line, separated by spaces.

Constraints


- 1 \leq N \leq 80
- 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9
- All input values are integers.

- There are 5 subsequences of length 1, all of which are arithmetic sequences.
- There are 10 subsequences of length 2, all of which are arithmetic sequences.
- There are 3 subsequences of length 3 that are arithmetic sequences: (A_1, A_2, A_3), (A_1, A_2, A_5), and (A_1, A_4, A_5).
- There are no arithmetic subsequences of length 4 or more.
