As KEYENCE headquarters have more and more workers, they decided to divide the departments in the headquarters into two groups and stagger their lunch breaks.
KEYENCE headquarters have N departments, and the number of people in the i-th department (1\leq i\leq N) is K_i.
When assigning each department to Group A or Group B, having each group take lunch breaks at the same time, and ensuring that the lunch break times of Group A and Group B do not overlap, find the minimum possible value of the maximum number of people taking a lunch break at the same time.
In other words, find the minimum possible value of the larger of the following: the total number of people in departments assigned to Group A, and the total number of people in departments assigned to Group B.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
K_1 K_2 \ldots K_N

Output

Print the minimum possible value of the maximum number of people taking a lunch break at the same time.

Constraints


- 2 \leq N \leq 20
- 1 \leq K_i \leq 10^8
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

5
2 3 5 10 12

Sample Output 1

17

When assigning departments 1, 2, and 5 to Group A, and departments 3 and 4 to Group B, Group A has a total of 2+3+12=17 people, and Group B has a total of 5+10=15 people. Thus, the maximum number of people taking a lunch break at the same time is 17.
It is impossible to assign the departments so that both groups have 16 or fewer people, so print 17.

Sample Input 2

2
1 1

Sample Output 2

1

Multiple departments may have the same number of people.

Sample Input 3

6
22 25 26 45 22 31

Sample Output 3

89

For example, when assigning departments 1, 4, and 5 to Group A, and departments 2, 3, and 6 to Group B, the maximum number of people taking a lunch break at the same time is 89.
