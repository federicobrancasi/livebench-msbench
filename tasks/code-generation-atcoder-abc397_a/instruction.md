Takahashi measured his body temperature and found it to be X {}^\circC.
Body temperature is classified into the following:

- Higher than or equal to 38.0 {}^\circC: “High fever”
- Higher than or equal to 37.5 {}^\circC and lower than 38.0 {}^\circC: “Fever”
- Lower than 37.5 {}^\circC: “Normal”

Which classification does Takahashi's body temperature fall into? Present the answer as an integer according to the Output section.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X

Output

Print an integer specified below corresponding to Takahashi's body temperature classification.

- High fever: 1
- Fever: 2
- Normal: 3

Constraints


- 30 \leq X \leq 50
- X is given to one decimal place.

Sample Input 1

40.0

Sample Output 1

1

His body temperature is 40.0 {}^\circC, which is classified as a high fever. Thus, print 1.

Sample Input 2

37.7

Sample Output 2

2

His body temperature is 37.7 {}^\circC, which is classified as a fever. Thus, print 2.

Sample Input 3

36.6

Sample Output 3

3

His body temperature is 36.6 {}^\circC, which is classified as a normal temperature. Thus, print 3.
