You are given a simple undirected graph with N vertices and M edges, where the vertices are labeled 1 to N. The i-th edge connects vertices u_i and v_i.
What is the minimum number of edges that need to be deleted from this graph so that the graph becomes a forest?

What is a forest?

A simple undirected graph F is called a forest if and only if F does not contain any cycle.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
u_1 v_1
u_2 v_2
\vdots
u_M v_M

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
- 0 \leq M \leq \min \left( \frac{N(N-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)
- 1 \leq u_i < v_i \leq N
- The given graph is simple.
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

4 4
1 2
1 3
2 4
3 4

Sample Output 1

1

For example, if you delete the first edge, the graph becomes a forest.
