You are given two positive integers N and M.
Let X = \displaystyle\sum_{i = 0}^{M} N^i. If X \leq 10^9, print the value of X. If X > 10^9, print inf.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M

Output

Print the value of X or inf as specified by the problem statement.

Constraints


- 1 \leq N \leq 10^9
- 1 \leq M \leq 100
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

7 3

Sample Output 1

400

X = 1 + 7 + 49 + 343 = 400. Since 400 \leq 10^9, print 400.

Sample Input 2

1000000 2

Sample Output 2

inf

X = 1000001000001 > 10^9, so print inf.

Sample Input 3

999999999 1

Sample Output 3

1000000000

Sample Input 4

998244353 99

Sample Output 4

inf
