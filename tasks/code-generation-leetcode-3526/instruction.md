You are given an m x n binary matrix grid.
A row or column is considered palindromic if its values read the same forward and backward.
You can flip any number of cells in grid from 0 to 1, or from 1 to 0.
Return the minimum number of cells that need to be flipped to make either all rows palindromic or all columns palindromic.
 
Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation:

Flipping the highlighted cells makes all the rows palindromic.

Example 2:

Input: grid = [[0,1],[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: 1
Explanation:

Flipping the highlighted cell makes all the columns palindromic.

Example 3:

Input: grid = [[1],[0]]
Output: 0
Explanation:
All rows are already palindromic.

 
Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m * n <= 2 * 10^5
0 <= grid[i][j] <= 1

Write your final answer to `/app/solution.py`.

## Starter Code
